# Bathroom Display

This is a small program written for an ESP8266 microcontroller in conjunction with a SSD1306 OLED - Display to
show various information such as the current Time, Date as well as Temperature and humidity data. 

The goal was to have a small screen next to my mirror to view the aforementioned data is a quick view.
